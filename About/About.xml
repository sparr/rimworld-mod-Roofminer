	<description>A designator for mining a connected set of mountain tiles that share a roof type (unroofed, constructed, thin rock, overhead mountain, etc).

The primary purpose is to mine tunnels and rooms in mountains that won't trigger infestations.

Thanks to Toasteh &amp; Ogliss &amp; the previous developers of Veinminer which this mod is based on.
